<MyText>Ctrl + J / Ctrl + Shift + J : Inline search, meaning you can type on the fly to search text in current editor.

2. Ctrl + K/ Ctrl + Shift + K : Search next selected text in forward or reverse direction.

3. Ctrl + L : Go to line.

4. Ctrl + Alt + Up/Down : <!-- Duplicate current line above/below.  -->Very useful in repeatative assignment statements.

5. Alt + Up/Down : Move current line up or down. Also, very handy to select current line.
